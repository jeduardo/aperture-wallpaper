## Browser process

To save the wallpaper:

- F12 for dev tools
- Command+Shift+P for action lookup
- Screenshot and Full Size Screenshot
- Save as PNG
- Use Equinox to create the wallpaper

## Automated process

```shell
npm run build
```

## Caveats

The browser **must** be a Chrome-based browser to work with light/dark themes.

## Dependencies

The [wallpapper](https://github.com/mczachurski/wallpapper) utility is required to generate dynamic wallpapers for macOS.

It can be installed with:

```shell
brew tap mczachurski/wallpapper
brew install wallpapper
x```
